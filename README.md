# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The following data and analysis were compiled to support a successful fundraiser for production of *Fever*. 

### Purpose
In an effort to support additional kickstarters for the production of *Fever*, we analyzed pre-existing kickstarter data to determine what factors may contribute to successful outcomes. By analyzing the kickstarter goals in relation to success rate, we can help determine what a additional realistic goals for *Fever* look like, and make suggestions for adjustments that could contribute to a better fundraising outcome. By analyzing kickstarter launch dates in relation to success rate, we can further improve chances for a successful outcome, even if only by avoiding months with extremely low success rates. Simply put, our data analysis is meant to take the lessons learned from other theater fundraisers and implement them to *Fever*'s benefit.
